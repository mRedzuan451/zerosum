## About the Game

Welcome to the **Neon Cypher**, the digital matrix where **Zero Sum** takes place. This game is designed for thinkers, risk-takers, and puzzle-solvers. The goal is simple: use your hand of number and operator cards to create an equation that gets you as close as possible to the target. It's easy to learn, but only the sharpest mind will be crowned **The Grand Calculator**.

## Key Features

* **Two Distinct Game Modes:** A simple **Junior Mode** for beginners and a deeply strategic **Pro Mode** for experts.
* **Unique "Showdown" Mechanic:** No waiting for long turns! All players reveal their equations simultaneously in a tense, competitive showdown.
* **Engaging Player Actions:** Go beyond just playing cards. **Recalculate** your hand to chase the perfect score.
* **Sleek "Neon Cypher" Theme:** Immerse yourself in a cool, high-tech world of glowing visuals, smooth animations, and a modern UI.
* **Multiplayer Focus:** Play in a quick match with randoms or set up a private room to challenge your friends.

## Gameplay & Rules

### Core Mechanics

* **The Deck:** A standard 52-card deck is re-purposed:
    * Aces = **1**
    * 2-10 = **Face value**
    * J, Q, K = Operators **`+`**, **`-`**, **`Ã—`**
* **The Goal:** Be the first player to score **5 points**.
* **Scoring:**
    * The player closest to the target in a **Showdown** wins **1 point**.
    * A tie (**Shared Victory**) results in all winners getting **1 point**.
    * An exact match (**Perfect Calculation**) wins **2 points**.

### Game Modes

The game mode is selected by the host in the game lobby.

#### Junior Mode
* **Target Number:** Generated from a random 3-card equation (e.g., `5 x 4 = 20`).
* **Gameplay:** Players can only play a simple 3-card equation (`Number-Operator-Number`).

#### Pro Mode
* **Target Number:** Generated from two flipped cards to form a 2-digit number (e.g., a 5 and a 2 is **52**).
* **Equation Chaining:** Players can use any number of cards from their hand to form a complex equation. Standard order of operations applies.
* **Strategic Grouping:** Players can group one `+` or `-` operation to have it calculate first.
* **Scavenging:** Players can choose to draw the top card from the discard pile instead of the deck.
* **Master Equation Bonus:** Win a round using 5 or more cards to score **+1 bonus point**.

### Player Actions (Per Turn)

1.  **Draw:** The player draws 1 card (or Scavenges in Pro Mode).
2.  **Choose an Action:**
    * **Commit:** Place cards face-down for the **Showdown**.
    * **Pass:** Discard 1 card and do not compete in the round.
    * **Recalculate:** Discard 2 cards to draw 1 new card, then must either Commit or Pass.
