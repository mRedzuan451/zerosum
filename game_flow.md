​Phase 1: Pre-Game & Main Menu
​Screen 1: The Splash Page
​Visuals: The screen is dark. The Zero Sum logo materializes with a futuristic neon-glow animation. A subtle, animated geometric pattern fades in for the background.
​Action: A single, glowing button appears: [ENTER].
​Flow: This is the single entry point. Clicking [ENTER] takes you to the Main Menu.
​Screen 2: The Main Menu
​Visuals: This is the central hub, fully embracing the "Neon Cypher" theme. The animated geometric background is active. The player's username/avatar is visible.
​Actions: This is the first MAJOR BRANCHING POINT. The player can choose from several neon-outlined buttons:
​BRANCH A ➔ [QUICK PLAY]: Jumps the player into an automatic matchmaking queue to find a game with random opponents.
​BRANCH B ➔ [PLAY WITH FRIENDS]: Takes the player to a screen where they can create a private game or join one with a code.
​BRANCH C ➔ [HOW TO PLAY]: Opens a sleek, scrollable overlay that explains the rules for Junior and Pro modes.
​BRANCH D ➔ [PROFILE/SETTINGS]: Leads to a screen for checking stats (win rate, total games, etc.) and adjusting settings (sound, animations).
​Phase 2: Game Setup & Lobby
​Screen 3A: Quick Play Queue (From Branch A)
​Visuals: A minimalist screen showing "Searching for Players..." with a cool, pulsating radar or data-stream animation.
​Flow: Once enough players are found, it automatically transitions to the Game Lobby (Screen 4).
​Screen 3B: Create / Join Room (From Branch B)
​Visuals: Two large, clear buttons.
​Actions: This is another BRANCHING POINT.
​BRANCH B1 ➔ [CREATE GAME]: The player becomes the "host" and is taken directly to the Game Lobby (Screen 4), where a unique room code is displayed for them to share.
​BRANCH B2 ➔ [JOIN GAME]: A modal pops up asking the player to enter a room code. Upon entering a valid code, they are taken to the Game Lobby (Screen 4).
​Screen 4: The Game Lobby
​Visuals: Player avatars are shown in their glowing hexagonal frames. A "Ready" status indicator is next to each player. There's a simple chat window for pre-game banter.
​Host Actions: The player who created the room (the host) has extra options. This is a crucial BRANCHING POINT that determines the game's ruleset.
​Game Mode Toggle: [JUNIOR MODE] <=> [PRO MODE].
​Flow: When all players have indicated they are "Ready," the host's [START GAME] button begins to glow brightly. Clicking it initiates the game and transitions everyone to the Game Table.
​Phase 3: The Gameplay Loop
​Screen 5: The Game Table
This is the main screen where the entire game is played. It's a continuous loop of turns until a winner is decided.
​Round Start:
​An animation shows cards being dealt to all players.
​The Target Number is generated in the center of the screen (using the "Equation Target" for Junior Mode or the "Two-Digit" method for Pro Mode).
​Your Turn:
​Your player area glows, and a "Your Turn" indicator appears.
​A card is automatically drawn from the deck and animated into your hand.
​Your action buttons become active: [COMMIT], [PASS], [RECALCULATE]. This is the main BRANCHING POINT for your turn.
​You drag-and-drop cards to the "Equation Zone" to test combinations. Once you're ready, you click one of the action buttons.
​Opponent's Turn:
​Their player area glows. You see a "Thinking..." status.
​You see their action resolve visually: either a card flies to the discard pile (Pass) or a set of card backs appears in their area (Commit).
​The Showdown:
​After the last player's turn, the screen dims for dramatic effect.
​A "SHOWDOWN" animation plays. The committed cards from all players fly to the center of the screen.
​The cards flip over one by one, revealing the equations and results. The difference from the target is displayed next to each result.
​The winning equation is highlighted with a burst of neon energy, and the winner's score is updated.
​Loop or End? The system checks if any player has reached 5 points.
​BRANCH A (No Winner Yet): The board is cleared, a "Next Round" button appears, and the loop returns to Step 1.
​BRANCH B (Winner Found!): The game ends and transitions to the final screen.
​Phase 4: End of Game
​Screen 6: Victory Screen
​Visuals: A grand, celebratory screen. The winner's avatar is displayed prominently with the title "THE GRAND CALCULATOR". Neon particle confetti rains down.
​Info: A final scoreboard shows the rankings of all players. Fun stats might be displayed ("Most Perfect Calculations," "Riskiest Recalculate," etc.).
​Actions: This is the final BRANCHING POINT.
​BRANCH A ➔ [PLAY AGAIN]: Sends all players who agree back to the Game Lobby (Screen 4) to start a new game.
​BRANCH B ➔ [RETURN TO MENU]: Takes the player back to the Main Menu (Screen 2).
